# My Personal Project

## A movie logger

The application will log the **movies** a user watches, alongside
details like:
- A rating e.g. from 0-10
- A review
- Whether the user would rewatch it 

The *intended user* would be anyone who would want to 
keep track of the movies they watch as well as how much they 
liked the movie. This project is of interest to me as I often
watch movies when I have the free time to do so, and having an
easy way to note down movies I watch as well as note down my 
thoughts on them as they are fresh.
